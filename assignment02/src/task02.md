# Task02

## Attributes
- Fast load time
- Secure payment network
- Clear easy appealing navigation and design
- Good brand
- Multiplatform availability
- Effective use of user data and his behaviour to offer suitable products
- Stability under load

**Why we chosen these attributes**  
- We most often see the features of these attributes in many existing e-shops. 
When choosing the attributes of an imaginary eshop, we therefore proceeded from the properties that we observed in successful existing eshops.  

**Minimizing chances that there are other attributes we do not see, but are of higher importance than selected**
- Discusion with team
- Alfa/Beta testing
- Analysis of project
